## Case Study Guide

This is a repo containing information on creating, publishing, and sharing case studies of past 18F projects. The template for this guide is a
[CFPB/DOCter](https://github.com/CFPB/DOCter)-based
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) template which is used for all
[18F Guides](http://18f.github.io/guides/).

### Why Create This Guide

Case studies are an important historical document that highlight the success and purpose of past projects. They offer insight into how future projects can be scoped and how they can be managed to mimic the success of past projects.

Not all case studies are created equal though, and some can only be used in certain contexts. This guide will help case study authors and contributers create new case studies and provide guidance in how case studies should be used going forward.
