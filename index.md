This is the 18F Guide for create, publishing, and sharing case studies that highlight past projects or solutions produced by 18F. The goal of this guide is to offer case study authors the tools they need to create new case studies for their projects. It will also offer guidance to the type, structure, and editorial guidelines that should be used when creating a new case study.

This 18F Guide is currently a work in progress and will be updated with new content in the coming weeks. Please stay tuned.
